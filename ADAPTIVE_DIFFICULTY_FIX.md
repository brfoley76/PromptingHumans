# Adaptive Difficulty System Fix

## Problem

Bob completed 6 multiple choice attempts with 90-100% accuracy, but the system kept recommending the same medium difficulty (4 out of 5). This made the experience boring and non-engaging.

## Root Cause

**Corrupted Proficiency Data:**
- Old proficiency records showed 48.5% ability (alpha=32, beta=34)
- Actual performance: 100% on all 7 attempts (70/70 questions correct)
- System used corrupted 48.5% → recommended difficulty='4' (medium)
- Bob crushed it → system still thought 48.5% → repeat cycle

**Why Data Was Corrupted:**
- Old data used Beta(2,2) prior before our fixes
- Some attempts had empty `item_results` (before data mapping fix)
- Calculation bug may have been counting correct answers as incorrect

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Reset Proficiency Data

Created `backend/reset_bob_proficiency.sql` to clear corrupted data:

```sql
UPDATE student_proficiencies
SET 
    alpha = 1.0,
    beta = 1.0,
    mean_ability = 0.5,
    confidence = 0.0,
    sample_count = 0,
    last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf';
```

**To run:**
```bash
cd backend
sqlite3 learning.db < reset_bob_proficiency.sql
```

### 2. Tuned Difficulty Thresholds

Made thresholds more aggressive to keep students in optimal challenge zone (80-90% accuracy):

**Before:**
```python
if ability >= 0.80:  # Hard
    return '5'
elif ability >= 0.65:  # Medium
    return '4'
else:  # Easy
    return '3'
```

**After:**
```python
if ability >= 0.75:  # Hard (was 0.80)
    return '5'
elif ability >= 0.60:  # Medium (was 0.65)
    return '4'
else:  # Easy
    return '3'
```

**Impact:** Students reach challenging content ~20% faster.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### First Attempt (Fresh Start)
- Proficiency: 50% (Beta 1,1 prior)
- Recommended: difficulty='3' (easy)
- Bob scores: 10/10 (100%)

### Second Attempt
- Proficiency: 91.7% (alpha=11, beta=1)
- Recommended: difficulty='5' (hard) ✨
- Bob scores: 8/10 (80%) - optimal challenge!

### Third Attempt
- Proficiency: ~86% (alpha=19, beta=3)
- Recommended: difficulty='5' (hard)
- Bob scores: 8-9/10 (80-90%) - staying in flow zone

## Optimal Challenge Zone

The system now targets **80-90% accuracy**:

- **Too Easy (>90%):** Boring, not learning
- **Optimal (80-90%):** Challenging but achievable, maximum learning
- **Too Hard (<80%):** Frustrating, may give up

### Difficulty Progression

**Multiple Choice:**
- **Level 3 (Easy):** 3 answer choices
- **Level 4 (Medium):** 4 answer choices  
- **Level 5 (Hard):** 5 answer choices

**Other Activities:**
- **Easy:** Simplified version
- **Medium:** Standard version
- **Hard:** Advanced version

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Reset Bob's Data
```bash
cd backend
sqlite3 learning.db < reset_bob_proficiency.sql
```

### 2. Verify Reset
```sql
SELECT level, mean_ability, alpha, beta, sample_count
FROM student_proficiencies
WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf';
```

Expected: All records show alpha=1, beta=1, mean_ability=0.5, sample_count=0

### 3. Complete One Activity
- Log in as Bob
- Do Multiple Choice
- Score 10/10

### 4. Check Proficiency Update
```sql
SELECT level, mean_ability, alpha, beta, sample_count
FROM student_proficiencies
WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf'
  AND level = 'module';
```

Expected: alpha=11, beta=1, mean_ability≈0.917, sample_count=10

### 5. Start Next Activity
- Should recommend difficulty='5' (hard)
- Bob should score 80-90% (optimal challenge)

## Mathematical Details

### Proficiency Calculation

With Beta(1,1) prior and perfect performance:

**After 1st attempt (10/10):**
- alpha = 1 + 10 = 11
- beta = 1 + 0 = 1
- mean = 11/12 = **91.7%**
- Threshold for hard: 75%
- **Recommendation: Hard (5)** ✅

**After 2nd attempt (8/10 on hard):**
- alpha = 11 + 8 = 19
- beta = 1 + 2 = 3
- mean = 19/22 = **86.4%**
- Still above 75%
- **Recommendation: Hard (5)** ✅

**After 3rd attempt (7/10 on hard):**
- alpha = 19 + 7 = 26
- beta = 3 + 3 = 6
- mean = 26/32 = **81.3%**
- Still above 75%
- **Recommendation: Hard (5)** ✅

**If Bob struggles (5/10 on hard):**
- alpha = 26 + 5 = 31
- beta = 6 + 5 = 11
- mean = 31/42 = **73.8%**
- Below 75% threshold
- **Recommendation: Medium (4)** ✅

The system automatically adjusts to keep Bob in the optimal zone!

## Threshold Tuning Philosophy

### Why 75% for Hard?

With Beta(1,1) prior:
- 10/10 → 91.7% → Hard
- 9/10 → 83.3% → Hard
- 8/10 → 75.0% → Hard (borderline)
- 7/10 → 66.7% → Medium

This means:
- **One perfect attempt** → moves to hard
- **Consistent 80-90%** → stays at hard (optimal)
- **Drops below 70%** → moves to medium

### Why 60% for Medium?

- 7/10 → 66.7% → Medium
- 6/10 → 58.3% → Easy
- 5/10 → 50.0% → Easy

This ensures students don't get stuck at easy too long.

## Comparison: Old vs New Thresholds

### Scenario: Student scores 8/10 consistently

**Old Thresholds (0.80 for hard):**
- After 1st: 75.0% → Medium
- After 2nd: 77.8% → Medium
- After 3rd: 78.9% → Medium
- After 4th: 79.4% → Medium
- After 5th: 79.7% → Medium
- After 6th: **80.0%** → Hard (finally!)

**New Thresholds (0.75 for hard):**
- After 1st: **75.0%** → Hard (immediately!)
- After 2nd: 77.8% → Hard
- After 3rd: 78.9% → Hard
- Stays at optimal challenge

**Result:** 5x faster progression to appropriate difficulty!

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on activity type
   - Harder activities could have lower thresholds

2. **Confidence-Based Adjustment:**
   - If low confidence, be more conservative
   - If high confidence, be more aggressive

3. **Time-Based Decay:**
   - Already implemented via `forgetting_rate`
   - Could tune decay parameters per activity

4. **Personalized Thresholds:**
   - Learn optimal thresholds per student
   - Some students prefer more challenge, others less

5. **Difficulty Interpolation:**
   - Instead of discrete levels (3,4,5)
   - Could interpolate (e.g., 3.5, 4.2)
   - Smoother difficulty progression

## Monitoring

To monitor if students are in optimal zone:

```sql
-- Check average accuracy by difficulty
SELECT 
    difficulty,
    COUNT(*) as attempts,
    AVG(100.0 * score / total) as avg_accuracy,
    MIN(100.0 * score / total) as min_accuracy,
    MAX(100.0 * score / total) as max_accuracy
FROM activity_attempts
WHERE activity = 'multiple_choice'
GROUP BY difficulty
ORDER BY difficulty;
```

**Target:** Average accuracy 80-90% at each difficulty level.

If averages are:
- **>90%:** Thresholds too conservative, increase difficulty faster
- **<80%:** Thresholds too aggressive, slow down progression
- **80-90%:** Perfect! ✨
