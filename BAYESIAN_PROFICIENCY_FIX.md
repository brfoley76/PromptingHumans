# Bayesian Proficiency System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Item-Level Proficiencies Not Updating
**Problem:** Item-level proficiency records had sample_count of 0 because the required fields were missing from the data.

**Root Cause:** 
- Backend expects: `result.get('item')` and `result.get('correct')`
- Frontend was sending: `isCorrect` (not `correct`) and no `item` field

**Fix:** Updated `web/js/app.js` to map frontend format to backend format:
```javascript
item_results: (results.answers || []).map(answer => ({
    ...answer,
    item: answer.correctAnswer,  // Item identifier for proficiency tracking
    correct: answer.isCorrect    // Boolean field expected by backend
}))
```

### Issue 2: Slow Learning Rate
**Problem:** Proficiency estimates were updating too slowly, making the adaptive system less responsive.

**Root Cause:** Conservative Beta(2, 2) prior meant each piece of evidence had minimal impact.

**Fix:** Changed to uninformative Beta(1, 1) prior in `backend/src/services/bayesian_proficiency.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_PRIOR_ALPHA = 1.0  # Was 2.0
DEFAULT_PRIOR_BETA = 1.0   # Was 2.0
```

## Impact Comparison

### Before Fixes

**With Beta(2, 2) prior:**
- After 10 responses at 80% accuracy: mean = 10/14 = **0.714**
- After 20 responses at 80% accuracy: mean = 18/24 = **0.750**
- After 30 responses at 80% accuracy: mean = 26/34 = **0.765**

**Item-level proficiencies:**
- ❌ Not updating (missing fields)
- ❌ sample_count = 0
- ❌ Can't provide focused recommendations

### After Fixes

**With Beta(1, 1) prior:**
- After 10 responses at 80% accuracy: mean = 9/11 = **0.818** ✨
- After 20 responses at 80% accuracy: mean = 17/21 = **0.810** ✨
- After 30 responses at 80% accuracy: mean = 25/31 = **0.806** ✨

**Item-level proficiencies:**
- ✅ Updating correctly
- ✅ sample_count increments
- ✅ Can identify weak items for focused practice

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/src/services/bayesian_proficiency.py`
**Changes:**
- `DEFAULT_PRIOR_ALPHA = 1.0` (was 2.0)
- `DEFAULT_PRIOR_BETA = 1.0` (was 2.0)

**Rationale:** Uninformative prior allows faster adaptation to student's actual performance.

### 2. `web/js/app.js`
**Changes:**
- Added data mapping in `showResults()` method
- Maps `answers` array to `item_results` with required fields
- Adds `item` field (item identifier)
- Adds `correct` field (boolean)

**Rationale:** Backend Bayesian system requires specific field names to update proficiencies.

## Testing

### Verify Item-Level Updates
```sql
-- Check item-level proficiencies for Bob
SELECT 
    item_id,
    sample_count,
    mean_ability,
    confidence,
    alpha,
    beta
FROM student_proficiencies
WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf'
  AND level = 'item'
ORDER BY mean_ability ASC;
```

**Expected:** 
- `sample_count` > 0 for items Bob has practiced
- `mean_ability` reflects actual performance
- `alpha` and `beta` show evidence accumulation

### Verify Faster Learning
```sql
-- Check module-level proficiency
SELECT 
    level,
    sample_count,
    mean_ability,
    alpha,
    beta,
    ROUND(alpha / (alpha + beta), 3) as calculated_mean
FROM student_proficiencies
WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf'
  AND level = 'module';
```

**Expected:**
- With good performance (80%+), `mean_ability` should be > 0.75 after 20-30 samples
- `alpha` should be much larger than `beta` for good performance

### Test New Activity Attempt
1. Log in as Bob
2. Complete Multiple Choice activity
3. Check database immediately after:
   ```sql
   -- Should see new item_results
   SELECT 
       json_array_length(item_results) as num_items,
       item_results
   FROM activity_attempts
   WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf'
   ORDER BY date DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
4. Verify item-level proficiencies updated:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as items_with_data
   FROM student_proficiencies
   WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf'
     AND level = 'item'
     AND sample_count > 0;
   ```

## Mathematical Details

### Beta Distribution Basics
- **Prior:** Beta(α₀, β₀) represents initial belief
- **Update:** After n successes and m failures: Beta(α₀+n, β₀+m)
- **Mean:** α / (α + β)
- **Variance:** αβ / [(α+β)²(α+β+1)]

### Why Beta(1,1) is Better for Learning
1. **Uninformative:** Represents no prior knowledge (uniform distribution)
2. **Responsive:** Each piece of evidence has maximum impact
3. **Fast Convergence:** Quickly adapts to student's true ability
4. **Still Bayesian:** Maintains probabilistic framework

### Example Calculation
Student completes 10 questions, gets 8 correct:

**With Beta(2,2) prior:**
- α = 2 + 8 = 10
- β = 2 + 2 = 4
- Mean = 10/14 = 0.714

**With Beta(1,1) prior:**
- α = 1 + 8 = 9
- β = 1 + 2 = 3
- Mean = 9/12 = 0.750

The Beta(1,1) prior gives a more accurate estimate of the 80% performance.

## Adaptive Recommendations

With working item-level proficiencies, the system can now:

1. **Identify Weak Items:**
   - Items with `mean_ability < 0.70` flagged for focus
   - Up to 5 focus items per activity

2. **Adjust Difficulty:**
   - `mean_ability >= 0.80` → Hard difficulty
   - `mean_ability >= 0.65` → Medium difficulty
   - `mean_ability < 0.65` → Easy difficulty

3. **Optimize Question Count:**
   - High ability + high confidence → 5 questions
   - Medium ability → 7 questions
   - Low ability or low confidence → 10 questions

4. **Skip Optional Activities:**
   - If `mean_ability >= 0.90` on optional activities
   - Offers skip with explanation

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- Bob's existing proficiency records will keep their current alpha/beta values
- New evidence will be added using the new prior
- Over time, old prior influence will diminish as evidence accumulates

### Reset Option (if needed)
If you want to reset Bob's proficiencies to use the new prior:

```sql
-- Reset to new prior (Beta 1,1)
UPDATE student_proficiencies
SET 
    alpha = 1.0,
    beta = 1.0,
    mean_ability = 0.5,
    confidence = 0.0,
    sample_count = 0
WHERE student_id = '140d959c-19a4-4d5d-81af-701a279b8aaf';
```

**Note:** This will lose all learning history. Better to let new evidence accumulate naturally.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Item Difficulty Weighting:**
   - Weight evidence by item difficulty
   - Harder items provide more information

2. **Time-Based Decay:**
   - Already implemented via `forgetting_rate`
   - Could tune decay parameters

3. **Cross-Module Transfer:**
   - Use domain-level proficiency to initialize new modules
   - Already supported in code

4. **Confidence Intervals:**
   - Display uncertainty to user
   - "You're probably between 70-85% on this topic"
